Motivation
==========

_groot_ is a helper tool that works along with git to simplify working
with submodules.

The main goal is to make it easier to get things right with
submodules. It just helps you do the steps you would do with git,
making sure steps aren't skipped and keeping things consistent.

_groot_ works with the native submodule mechanisms. Other users of the
same repository (or more exactly, remote clones) do not have to use
groot if they don't want to. All of the normal git commands can be
used as normal.
